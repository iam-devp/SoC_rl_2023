# SoC_rl_2023
In this project, I aim to create an intelligent stock portfolio management system that utilizes the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The primary goal is to optimize the allocation of stocks in a portfolio to achieve superior returns while managing risk effectively. 
I have used OpenAI gym to decide stocks allocation each day and was able to generate exceptional results of 788% vs 140% of 50-50 split buy and hold portfolio.
The universe is ITC and BAJFINANCE of which ITC has a low beta of 0.59 and BAJAJ FINANCE has a high beta of 1.73
Timeframe = daily
Data-range = 2009-01-01 till 2023-07-21
Here are the results.
